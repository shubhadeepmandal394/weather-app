Weather is a android mobile application developed by Shubhadeep Mandal to view the weather condition of a particular city(one at a time). It accepts the name of any city in the world as an input and displays the weather description, maximum/average/minimum temperature(in Â°C), pressure(in hPa), humidity(in %), and wind speed(in m/s).
